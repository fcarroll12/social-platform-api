# social-platform-api

## Description

This project is an API social platform web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. The application uses a NoSQL database and can handle big quantities of unstructered data. The mongoose models are synced to the MondoDB database and the application is started in the command line. I learnt a lot about MongoDB and Mongoose building this application, as well as just setting up the necessary Models and API routes. While this application isn't completely finished, I hope to come back and fix the bugs to get all routes working successfully in Insomnia.

## Installation

Start the application by running npm i, npm i mongoose, npm i express, and then invoking the server in the command line with `npm start`.
